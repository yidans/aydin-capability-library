# Word Count Conventions

**Spec:** v3.6.7 §7.1 — pattern protection reference for `report_compiler_agent` (abstract-only mode).

**Audience:** Agents budgeting word counts under a hard cap (abstract, executive summary, INSIGHT block). Human authors verifying that an agent's word count matches the publisher's.

**Why this exists:** Different word-count algorithms produce different totals on the same text. The differential is small per sentence but compounds: on a 250-word abstract, the choice between whitespace-split and hyphenated-as-1 can swing the total by ~12 words. An agent that uses a different algorithm than the publisher believes it is meeting the cap when it is over by 5%. This reference fixes a single canonical algorithm for ARS pipelines, documents how publishers diverge, and specifies the buffer rule that makes minor publisher variation safe.

## The canonical algorithm: whitespace-split

ARS pipelines count words as `len(body.split())` in Python — that is, splits on any whitespace run and counts the resulting non-empty tokens.

### Why whitespace-split

1. **Reproducible.** Anyone running `len(body.split())` on the same UTF-8 text gets the same number. No hidden tokenizer state.
2. **Matches Microsoft Word default.** Most authors check word count in Word, which uses a whitespace-equivalent algorithm. Aligning with the dominant authoring environment minimises surprise.
3. **Predictable under hyphenation.** "State-of-the-art" counts as 1 token under whitespace-split. Under hyphenated-as-N this would count as 4. Because whitespace-split can report the lower total, it is not inherently safer for a hard cap; use the buffer below or the venue's higher authoritative count.
4. **English-output aligned.** The package produces English public artifacts, where whitespace-split is a practical universal lower bound.

### What whitespace-split counts

| Token | Whitespace-split count |
|---|---|
| `state-of-the-art` | 1 |
| `2020-2024` | 1 |
| `Smith, John-Paul` | 2 (`Smith,` and `John-Paul`) |
| `e.g.,` | 1 |
| `123,456` | 1 |
| `(n=42)` | 1 |
| `https://example.org/path` | 1 |

### What whitespace-split does NOT count

- Whitespace runs collapse to one delimiter; they do not contribute tokens.
- Empty strings between consecutive whitespace characters are filtered by `split()` with no argument.
- Markdown formatting (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``) is part of the surrounding token; the asterisks and backticks are not separate tokens.

## Publisher conventions and how to adapt

Most publishers use a whitespace-equivalent algorithm in practice but state different conventions in their author guidelines. The 3–5% buffer rule (below) makes ARS pipelines robust to the convention divergence without per-publisher adapters.

### Common publisher families

| Publisher / venue | Stated algorithm | Practical effect |
|---|---|---|
| Springer / Nature | whitespace-equivalent for abstract, no explicit definition | matches ARS canonical |
| IEEE | "approximately N words" — whitespace-equivalent in their submission tool | matches ARS canonical |
| ACM | whitespace-equivalent in CCS submission | matches ARS canonical |
| Elsevier (Cell, Lancet families) | whitespace-equivalent in EM submission | matches ARS canonical |
| Wiley | whitespace-equivalent | matches ARS canonical |
| arXiv | no hard cap on abstract; advisory ~250 words | guideline only |
| ICLR / NeurIPS / ACL workshop tracks | hyphenated-as-1 in their LaTeX `\abstract{}` counter | matches ARS canonical |
| Some social-science journals (variable) | "page-based" — abstract must fit visually on submission template | not a true word count; check template |

### When the publisher uses a more conservative algorithm

Some non-English-medium publishers and a small number of style guides count hyphenated compounds as multiple words. If the publisher explicitly states "hyphenated words count as separate words":

1. Calibration should compute both totals: `len(body.split())` and the hyphenated-as-N variant.
2. The dispatch context to the abstract compiler should carry both numbers.
3. The compiler should use the more conservative (higher) total when budgeting.

If the publisher's algorithm is ambiguous, default to ARS canonical (whitespace-split) plus the 3–5% buffer.

## The 3–5% buffer rule

ARS pipelines reserve **3–5% below the publisher's stated hard cap** as buffer. For a 250-word abstract:

- 3% buffer → target 242 words
- 5% buffer → target 237 words

### Why this range

1. **Algorithm divergence absorbs into the buffer.** Even if the publisher's tool counts ~3% higher than `len(body.split())`, the abstract still meets the cap.
2. **Editor-side trimming room.** Reviewers and copy editors occasionally request a phrase change that adds 2–3 words. Abstract that lands at exactly the cap forces a downstream cut; abstract that lands at cap minus 5% accommodates the change without cut.
3. **Title plus abstract pages.** Some publishers count the running title or running header; the buffer absorbs that too.

### When to use 3% vs. 5%

- **3%** when the calibration's `protected_hedges` block is large (≥10% of cap word budget). Tighter buffer keeps room for substantive content.
- **5%** when the publisher's algorithm is unstated or the protected hedges are minimal. Looser buffer absorbs more uncertainty.

### When NOT to use buffer

Do not add the generic buffer when the venue's submission system provides the
authoritative count for the final text and that count has been verified directly.
Also do not apply it when a venue specifies an exact range and the buffer would
push the manuscript below the minimum. Explicit venue rules always override the
ARS default.

## Where this convention is enforced

The `report_compiler_agent` abstract-only mode prompt enforces the canonical algorithm, the 3–5% buffer, and the post-draft re-verification step. The authoritative protection clause lives in `capabilities/deep-research/agents/report_compiler_agent.md` under `PATTERN PROTECTION (v3.6.7)`. This file defines the algorithm, the buffer rationale, and the publisher-convention escape hatches; the agent prompt cites this file by path.
